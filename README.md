In this mock up I altered the web page to be as user friendly as possible.
To achieve this I started out by seperating the HTML doc and adding proper HTML Semantic Elements.

First was the "head" the contained the style sheet and title of the webpage
Next I moved into making a "body" tag which includes the "header", "main", "aside", and "footer" tag.

Adding these tags helps properly see where information is placed and makes it easier for the user to identify the webpage when looking at the HTML.

Next I started to change what was located in the header tag, by adding a "Nav" tag to properly display a navigation bar at the top of the screen which includes links to navigate the webpage.

After the Header tag I added the img and class"hero" from the CSS page onto the HTML to easliy located the image when you inspect the code on the webpage. I also added an Alt text to properly describe the image and make it known.
With these changes I had to also change the CSS .hero to work properly and display the image correctly

Next I added a MAIN tag to properly show the info that was being display in the webpage, I made this apart of the main tag because it is the main information on the page.
Now that I've changed the main tag to display the main information on the page, I added "section tags" to properly identify each section of information.
These sections include "IMG tags" that also contain "Alt" information to explain what each image is being displayed on the webpage.

I've closed of my main tag and added an "Aside" tag in order to display information on the side of the webpage. This info is not apart of the main tag because it is information that is meant to be on the side as extra notes.
I also changed all the classes located in the "Aside" tag to 2 different classes instead of having multiple classes for each div located in the Aside tage.
This change helped me condense my CSS file and have less cluter to make it easier to edit and find the proper class located in the Aside tag.

Now my aside tag is closed and I have added a Footer tag at the bottom of the script.

my Footer is closed and now I have closed my body with all the above tags located inside of the Body.

In my CSS I have condensed a lot of unnecessary tags that were making the CSS file bigger then it needed to be. This helped making it easier to locate certain classes and easier to fix for another user in the future. 

I have also structed the CSS file to follow the HTML file in the same order it is written.
