In this mock up I altered the web page to be as user friendly as possible.
To achieve this I started out by seperating the HTML doc and adding proper HTML Semantic Elements.

First was the "head" the contained the style sheet and title of the webpage
Next I moved into making a "body" tag which includes the "header", "main", "aside", and "footer" tag.

Adding these tags helps properly see where information is placed and makes it easier for the user to identify the webpage when looking at the HTML.

Next I started to change what was located in the header tag, by adding a "Nav" tag to properly display a navigation bar at the top of the screen which includes links to navigate the webpage.
